Decide if I want to cleanup and only keep the stuff I need now in Brewfile for example (brew bundle cleanup)
Use submodules for resources, like themes, color schemes, fonts etc
Split nvim config into different components and just source them in the nvim init file
Actually redo the entire configuration of nvim atleast

Only plugins that I really need:
- coc (do not install the extensions until you need them)
- coc-explorer
- fzf
- color scheme (always have one dark and one light, so look into onedark?)
- maybe airline? and tmux airline?
- git gutter?
